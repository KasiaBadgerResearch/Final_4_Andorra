# Does the share of the population living in urban areas coincide with changes in domestic government health expenditure in Andorra between 2000 and 2020?

## Abstract

Urbanization and public health investment are both central to development, yet their relationship in Andorra has not been systematically analyzed. This study uses World Bank World Development Indicators to examine trends in the share of the population living in urban areas and domestic government health expenditure (% of total government expenditure) from 2000 to 2020. The data reveal that urban population slightly decreased over the period, while government health expenditure fluctuated dramatically from year to year but generally declined by about half. These descriptive patterns suggest that shifts in urbanization were largely independent of public health spending trends. The analysis highlights the importance of understanding how demographic and policy variables interact, even in small, high-income contexts.

## 1. Question

Does the share of the population living in urban areas coincide with changes in domestic government health expenditure in Andorra between 2000 and 2020?

- **Proxy for urbanization**: Urban population (% of total population)
- **Measure of public investment**: Domestic general government health expenditure (% of total government expenditure)

## 2. Data

- **Source**: World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
- **Indicators**:
  - Urban population (% of total population)
  - Domestic general government health expenditure (% of total government expenditure)
- **Coverage**: Andorra, 2000–2020
- **Notes**: Only national-level data

## 3. Method

1. Filtered dataset for Andorra.
2. **Selected relevant columns**: Year, Indicator Name, Value.
3. Pivoted indicators into separate columns and sorted by year.
4. Produced a line graph comparing urban population and government health expenditure over time.

(Analysis is descriptive; no causal inference applied.)

## 4. Results

- **Urban population (% of total population)**: Slightly decreased over the period, showing a modest decline in the share of residents living in urban areas.
- **Government health expenditure (% of total government expenditure)**: Highly variable from year to year, but generally declined by approximately 50% over the two decades.
- **Comparison**: Trends in urbanization and health spending did not move together, suggesting largely independent dynamics.

## 5. Interpretation

- Urbanization in Andorra slightly decreased, indicating that demographic shifts toward urban living were modest.
- Public health spending exhibited significant volatility, pointing to policy, budgetary, or economic influences rather than demographic drivers.
- These findings suggest that, in Andorra, government investment in health was not closely aligned with urban population trends, highlighting the complex interaction of policy priorities and demographic structure even in small, high-income countries.

## 6. Limitations

- Only two indicators analyzed.
- National-level data only; no regional breakdowns.
- No causal relationships tested.

## 7. Next Steps / Extensions

- Examine additional health and demographic indicators (e.g., life expectancy, healthcare access).
- Incorporate subnational or municipal data to study heterogeneity.
- Apply econometric methods to explore potential causal relationships.
- Compare Andorra’s patterns with other small, high-income countries to identify common dynamics and policy implications.
